                  With important issues like healthcare, employment and the
                  economy, you may be wondering why your social media habits are
                  so important. Does it really matter if you share something that
                  turns out to be not true?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>It does. A lot.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sharing bad information about health issues may lead others to
                  do things that can cause real harm. People have died from taking
                  things they were told were cures for COVID-19. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not all incorrect info is dangerous, but it creates clutter and
                  makes it more diﬃcult for the good stuﬀ to get through.

                  Before you decide whether or not to respond to bad information,
                  think about the following:
                </h4>
                <dl>
                  <dt class="h4">
                    How dangerous is the info?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    All misinformation does harm on some level, but some things - like
                    telling people to take unproven cures or ignore public health
                    advice - is especially dangerous.
                  </dd>
                  <dt class="h4">
                    Is this person likely to convince their audience?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    If they seem to have inﬂuence or if they’re someone that others
                    are likely to listen to (politician, celebrity, family member),
                    it’s pretty important for you to push back.
                  </dd>
                  <dt class="h4">
                    How big is the person’s audience?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    It’s not the best idea to draw attention to a false statement
                    that few would see anyway. If their audience is a lot smaller
                    than the audience who would see your reply, you might be
                    better oﬀ ignoring it, or telling them in private.
                  </dd>
                  <dt class="h4">
                    What’s your relationship to the person?
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    If someone you care about is sharing false info, you probably want to let them know.

                    <h4 class="h4">
                      Here’s how to do it:
                    </h4>
                    <ul class="list list--bullet">
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Don’t just call them out for being wrong (that can be a
                          little embarrassing for them). Instead, help them by
                          sharing good information from a reliable source.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Focus on the values you have in common. No one wants to
                          cause harm. Saying, “We all care about keeping people as
                          safe as we can” is a great way to start.
                        </p>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Ask leading questions to show how unlikely the bad info
                          is. “If there really was a cure, why wouldn’t news
                          outlets be covering such big news? If there is some kind
                          of conspiracy, could every government in the world
                          really be part of it?” are the type of questions that
                          can help.

                  Good questions to ask. Look, right now, we’re all seeing science
                  happen in real time. Scientists are learning more about this
                  virus every day. A new discovery today can change what every
                  scientist knew yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When most experts agree, based on the evidence, that something
                  is true, the scientific consensus changes and public health
                  authorities adapt their advice to reflect it. That doesn’t mean
                  they were wrong before, just that the scientific consensus they
                  were working from has changed.

                      Dealing with the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 will
                      require us to come at it from every possible angle. We
                      need trusted voices to <a class="link"
                      href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01356-y">provide</a>
                      strong, clear and sharable counter-messaging on social
                      media. And we need regulators to go after those who are
                      deliberately spreading misinformation for personal gain.
                      But perhaps the most important strategy will be to empower
                      people with the tools necessary to be more critical
                      consumers of information. This should include teaching
                      both critical thinking skills and <a class="link"

                      A simple and effective “pre-bunk” <a class="link"

                      is to remind social media users to pause and think about
                      accuracy before sharing. Research has found that people
                      want to be <a class="link"

                      and want to share only factual material. Most users do not
                      fall for or share misinformation due to a personal agenda
                      or, even, a <a class="link"

                      bias</a>. As such, if we can nudge people to think about
                      accuracy prior to sharing social media content (which is
                      the goal of the MediaSmarts’ #CheckThenShare campaign!) we
                      could have a significant impact on the spread of
                      misinformation. A 2020 <a class="link"
                      href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/pausing-reduce-false-news/">study</a>
                      found that simply asking people to consider why a headline
                      might be true or false – which forced research
                      participants to pause and think about accuracy – “can
                      reduce shares of false information.” And another <a

                      context of the coronavirus found this same effect.

                      consensus</a> on a topic can be a helpful strategy in the
                      fight against misinformation. For example, a 2015 <a

                      (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective
                      pro-vaccine message..” And the strategy has been found to
                      work, at least to some degree, for other controversial

                      In such times it is important to be explicit about the
                      ambiguities of the evidence. Indeed, there is some
                      evidence that being transparent about uncertainties can

                      Perhaps more importantly, we should view these situations
                      of uncertainty as an opportunity to reflect on the nature
                      of the scientific process. We need to remind others (and
                      ourselves!) that “science” is not an immutable list of
                      facts. It isn’t an institution or, even, a particular
                      authoritative expert. It is a process. It is <a

                      And as such, the conclusions and recommendations that are
                      informed by science will (and should!) change and evolve.

                      due to new evidence, they aren’t flip-flopping, they’re
                      doing their job!
