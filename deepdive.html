              <p>
                Dealing with the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 will
                require us to come at it from every possible angle. We
                need trusted voices to <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01356-y">provide</a>
                strong, clear and sharable counter-messaging on social
                media. And we need regulators to go after those who are
                deliberately spreading misinformation for personal gain.
                But perhaps the most important strategy will be to empower
                people with the tools necessary to be more critical
                consumers of information. This should include teaching
                both critical thinking skills and <a class="link" target="_blank"

                literacy</a>, such as inoculating (or “<a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-society/2019/10/07/the-new-science-of-prebunking-how-to-inoculate-against-the-spread-of-misinformation/">pre-bunking</a>”)
                people against misinformation.
              </p>

              <p>
                A simple and effective “pre-bunk” <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31916834">approach</a>
                is to remind social media users to pause and think about
                accuracy before sharing. Research has found that people
                want to be <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/16/most-people-who-share-fake-news-do-care-about-the-accuracy-of-news-items-theyre-just-distracted/">accurate</a>
                and want to share only factual material. Most users do not
                fall for or share misinformation due to a personal agenda
                or, even, a <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771830163X">partisan
                bias</a>. As such, if we can nudge people to think about
                accuracy prior to sharing social media content (which is
                the goal of the MediaSmarts’ #CheckThenShare campaign!) we
                could have a significant impact on the spread of
                misinformation. A 2020 <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/pausing-reduce-false-news/">study</a>
                found that simply asking people to consider why a headline
                might be true or false – which forced research
                participants to pause and think about accuracy – “can
                reduce shares of false information.” And another <a
                class="link" href="https://psyarxiv.com/uhbk9/">recent</a>
                study that specifically looked at misinformation in the
                context of the coronavirus found this same effect.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pausing and thinking about accuracy works!

                consensus</a> on a topic can be a helpful strategy in the
                fight against misinformation. For example, a 2015 <a
                class="link"
                href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635296">study</a>
                found that “emphasizing the medical consensus about
                (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective
                pro-vaccine message..” And the strategy has been found to
                work, at least to some degree, for other controversial
                issues, such as the <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489">science</a>
                of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="">climate change</a>. This
                approach is especially effective if it is utilized by
                trusted voices, such as healthcare professionals,
                scientific experts and public <a class="link" target="_blank"

                as it is with the current pandemic?
              </p>
              <p>
                In such times it is important to be explicit about the
                ambiguities of the evidence. Indeed, there is some
                evidence that being transparent about uncertainties can
                actually heighten <a class="link" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315168821/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315168821-8">credibility</a>,

                href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347947">understanding</a>.
                Perhaps more importantly, we should view these situations
                of uncertainty as an opportunity to reflect on the nature
                of the scientific process. We need to remind others (and
                ourselves!) that “science” is not an immutable list of
                facts. It isn’t an institution or, even, a particular
                authoritative expert. It is a process. It is <a

                href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/science/coronavirus-uncertainty-scientific-trust.html">uncertain</a>.
                And as such, the conclusions and recommendations that are
                informed by science will (and should!) change and evolve.
              </p>
              <p>
                When science-informed decision makers change their mind
                due to new evidence, they aren’t flip-flopping, they’re
                doing their job!
